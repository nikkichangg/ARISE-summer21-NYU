# FloodSense ARISE 2021
NYU Tandon's ARISE (Applied Research Innovation in Science & Engineering) program is a 7 week summer program that allows students to work with research labs. The Environmental Engineering and Water Treatment Lab (FloodSense) aims to provide access to real-time information and data on flooding to aid city agencies and residents.

## Introduction

As sea levels rise and weather patterns change, flooding will become a more frequent occurence. Flooding in New York City has increased in part due to its coastal location and the humidity that results from it and ultimately how the sewer systems can haldle these changes. Roughly 70% of New York City utilizes a combined sewer system where both stormwater/runoff and regular sewage are combined to lead to the same wastewater treatment facility together.

## Communities Impacted by Urban Flooding

This case study explores the different neighborhoods in New York City and the lives of those who live in flood prone areas in order to harbor a better understanding of the the extent to which urban flooding has impacted them. Neighborhoods like Marble Hill and Chelsea are notorious for having some of the most frequent flooding in the city.  

#### Marble Hill

Marble Hill, located above the Harlem River as the most nothernmost neighborhood of Manhattan, is the most heavily flooded neighborhood in New York City. It's geographical history as a former wetland contributes to its vulnerability to flooding. The Eastern side of Broadway near the Matble Hill Houses are one of the most affected areas in Marble Hill–the streets often accumulating with seweage contaminated rain/storm water. 

#### Chelsea

Chelsea, also a neighborhood in Manhattan, lies off the Hudson River in midtown west Manhattan in the art district. 
## Current Mitigation Efforts for Urban Flooding

Pavement and other urban development structures minimize the natural vegetation cover (like grass) that would have infiltrated into soil rather than flow into sewers, where chances of flooding are increased. Efforts to prevent urban flooding try to increase the porosity of surfaces in the city to mitigate runoff as well as introducing new sewer systems to better handle the extremity of water.

#### Low Impact Development (LID) Structures
- Decreases the amount of runoff produced and infiltrates the stormwater into the soil
- Mimics the natural processes that normally would have been in place of the pavement
- A few examples:
    - New York City's "Rain Gardens" & "Green Infrastructure"
        - Rain Gardens are planted throughout the city with native species to store and infiltrate the water
        - Permeable paving: pavement is permeable (pervious concrete & asphalt) to allow subsoil infiltration.
        - Rain barrels: collects rainwater from rooftop drainpipes, prevents it from becoming runoff. Collected water is reused to water plants and other landscaping uses.
        - Green Roofs: a drainage layer sits below vegetation growing in engineered soil on top, reduces the amount of rainwater that becomes runoff or ends up in sewers
    - Infiltration trenches: shallow concaves with highly permeable soil that is used to temporarily store the runoff
    - Bioretention swales: shallow, vegetated, depressions with sloped sides which act as a channel to capture the runoff
    - Bioretention ponds: same as rain garden but w/ hydraulic structures to increase storage

#### Storm Water Management Systems (SWMS)
- Operates by draining the excess storm water into the nearest body of water and essentially is a revision of the sewage system
- In New York City
    - Seperate Storm Sewer System ("Grey Infrastructure"): Seperate pipes are used to carry storm water and waste water. Wastewater goes through the sewer which lead directly to wastewater treatment plants whereas the stormwater to local waterways
    - Bluebelt system: The Bluebelt drainage plan for these 16 watersheds connects natural drainage corridors with conventional storm sewers for an integrated stormwater management system
    - Other efforts include: installing backflow valves, improving stormwater and sewage pipes, and increasing effectiveness of catch basin and storm drain maintenance.

#### Effectiveness of Mitigation Methods

###### Storm water management systems:
  While these systems are efficient in managing flood waters and optimizing the performance of wastewater treatment facilities, they still pose risks to nearby bodies of water that the stormwater is deposited into. The runoff sweeps up all debris and other pollutants from streets and buildings into our waterways without being treated first. As a result, this causes the bodies of water to be unsafe for wildlife and their habitats as well as pose threats to public health through contaminants in the water that can be spread in food, drinking water, and when used recreationally. In order for a separate sewer system to be effective, adequate maintenance of receiving waters and sewer systems are necessary.

###### LID Structures:
  A 2010 study found that these LID structures present in New York City was able to decrease 30-78% of peak flow (Alfredo et al., 2013) and then a 2013 study found that LID structures were even able to reduce building damage from hurricane Sandy in 2012 in New York (Hewitt et. al, 2019). However, in order for LID structures to be further effective in the future, they have to take response for climate change and adjust for the potential increase in rainfall intensity. In addition, while the LID structures have been effective, there are still drawbacks considering the effort and cost required to maintain these structures. For instance, retention ponds lose their effectiveness with time because how costly it is to maintain them and even porous materials eventually lose their perviousness with time as well.
